## Description  

Weatherman is a web application that provides real-time and future weather conditions for multiple cities. Users can search for a city to view details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data in a user-friendly format. Additionally, the search history is saved for quick access to previous locations. This project focuses on integrating the back end with a provided front-end interface. I also used the Xpert learning assistant application to help clean and review my code.
